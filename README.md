When sending emails via SMTP using smtplib, you typically need to use an application-specific password or app password if you have enabled two-factor authentication (2FA) on your email account. Here’s a breakdown of which password to use for various scenarios:

1. Standard Password (Without 2FA)
If you haven't enabled two-factor authentication (2FA) on your email account, you can use your regular email account password for SMTP authentication. This is generally not recommended due to security concerns.

2. App Password (With 2FA Enabled)
If you have enabled 2FA on your email account, you need to generate an app password to use with SMTP. Here’s how to do this for popular email providers:

Gmail
      Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):
      
      Go to Google Account Security Settings.
      Follow the steps to enable 2FA if you haven't already.
      Generate an App Password:
      
      Go to App Passwords.
      Select "Mail" as the app and "Other" (give it a custom name like "Python script") as the device.
      Click "Generate" to get the app password.
   
Outlook/Hotmail
        Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):
        
        Go to Microsoft Account Security.
        Follow the steps to enable 2FA if you haven't already.
        Generate an App Password:
        
        Go to Microsoft Account App Passwords.
        Select "Create a new app password."
        
Yahoo
        Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):

        Generate an App Password:
